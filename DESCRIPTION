Description: Functions to access the database of 217 data-frames with aggregate 
    study-level characteristics (that may act as effect modifiers) extracted 
    from published systematic reviews with network meta-analysis 
    (see Spineli et al., (2025) <doi:10.1186/s12874-025-02634-x>). 
    The database shall only be used for developing and appraising the 
    methodology to assess the transitivity assumption quantitatively.
